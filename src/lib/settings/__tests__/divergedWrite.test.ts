/**
 * #200 step 1 — a write the plugin could not confirm stops being called a
 * success.
 *
 * Until now `verify` was a boolean and the one case that is neither success nor
 * failure — the file replaced by somebody else — was reported as `true`. Every
 * argument about who owns `data.json` rests on that status, so it has to stop
 * saying something untrue before reconciliation is built on top of it.
 *
 * `diverged` is deliberately NOT `failed`, and the difference is the whole
 * point: a failed write is retried, by the writer and by the user. A diverged
 * one must not be, because the retry IS the overwrite of somebody else's
 * change.
